# ðŸ’¡ Light-Based Bulb Glowing System Using LDR and Arduino

This project uses a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure ambient light intensity. When the light level falls below a certain threshold (indicating darkness), an LED or a bulb connected to the Arduino will turn on automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To detect low light conditions and automatically switch on a bulb or LED using an Arduino and an LDR.

## ðŸ”§ Components Required

- Arduino Uno/Nano
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kÎ© Resistor
- LED or bulb (with relay if using AC bulb)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
